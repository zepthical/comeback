# This is me.
The person who hate peoples.

The person who hate betrayal.

The person who hate almost everything except nature.

But i would like to go outside. But there's one thing stopping me from it.
Everyone.
You, peoples destroying everything.
I can't go anywhere, the only place i can be is here, Social.
Internet is the thing scared me the most since i was a kid.
But now it's curing me from depression.
